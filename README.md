# FinancialCalculator
This calculator visibly displays the advantages of investing your money versus saving it in a bank account.

A couple of assumptions are made with this calculator:

1. This calculator assumes you can invest in a ROTH IRA and a 401k. While this program is tailored to more mature audiences, future versions of this code can be adapted to have selectable options. In the meantime, it is still a good representation of what your potential growth would like if you had a substanital influx of cash and a job that offered a 401k. 

2. It should be noted that this calculator assumes you invest all of your savings into the S&P500 which has historical annual return rate of 10%. However, I chose to randomize the percentage of annual return from -2 to 14. You can change this to more accuratley match the S&P500 or your portfolio. 

3. This program assumes that you earn more than you spend. If you do not fit this criteria, the program will tell you to fix your priorities and quite the program. Future versions could take into account potential losses in profit, but again this is to see the effect of investment growth.

How does it work?

You start by inputting all the information the program asks for including before tax salary, expenses, age, etc. 

Then, the program will allocate your funds to maximize your profits. 

Next, assuming you haven't reached your financial goal before the information update increment, the program will ask you to update your information. 

Finally, once you hit your financial goal the program will output several items:
1. The program will output a series of text displaying how long it took to achieve your finanical goal, how much money was invested into each invesment category, how much you would have by saving, and finnaly how much more money you made by investing versus saving. 
4. A graph will appear displaying the your wealth grow over time collectively, individually, and if you were to put it into a bank.

Things to Improve:
1. Future versions of this code can be adapted to have selectable options such as whether or not you have a ROTH IRA or 401k.
2. Future versions could take into account potential losses in profit assuming you spend more than you make. 

Hope you enjoy the code!
